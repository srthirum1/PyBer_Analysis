# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
- The goal of this project is to help the ceo visualize understand ride sharing data and how much avg fare costs are, how many drivers there are per city type, (urban, suburbs, and rural), the goal is to take these large data set points understand key analysis points from the visualizations. 

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

- The data outcomes were expected, the outcome was that rural fares were much higher, with lower drivers and ride count overall, where as urban areas where cities were more populated had cheaper and more competitive fares but high avg total fares due to higher amounts of rides, higher ride counts and more overall drivers present in the city. 
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- In any large data set, it is more than likely there are extremedies within the data set, for example drivers might charge high fares due to damage, this might mess up the total avg for fares. Its important to understand rural drivers and activity will always be lower than cities since most people will have access to vehicles to get around since driving is a required to get around. I recomment that ceo take into account these outliers in the data and to into the std deviation when analyzing the dataset and taking a look at the line graph I have created.
